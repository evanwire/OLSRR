<h1 align="center">OLSRR to Python</h1>

## Abstract
I am working to take all of the funcitonality in the OLSRR r library and convert it to Python while maintianing similar syntax structure. This provides users with
the ability to perform linear regression, compare different models, and gain insights into the accuracy of their models.

## Installation
``$ git clone https://github.com/evanwire/OLSRR.git``

*I will upload this library to PyPip once I thoroughly test it.*

## Documentation
Please refer to https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/olsrr/olsrr.pdf, I am currently working to write the documentation for this library.
